Config infos:
"Visuals" is part of config file with configs for visual 
It will decide what colors to use while printing out text.
I'll not explain how does it work, it isn't that hard to firgure out, be better.

Example of config above:
 "Visuals":{ 
        "mainColor":null,
        "secondColor":null,
        "thirdColor":null,
        "errorColor":null,
        "warningColor":null
    }
NOTE: replace "null" with one of these:
blue cyan green magenta red white yellow

"encriptionConfig" is part, where configs about encryption of packets will be stored.
At point where I am writing this, I didn't make the encryption part yet, so this text will be replaced in future.

Example of config above:
"encriptionConfig":{
        "wayToEncrypt":null,
        "encryptKey":null
    }
NOTE: will be better

"connectionConfig" is part, where Ips and ports will be stored.

Example of config above:
 "connectionConfig":{
        "checkForVPN":false,
        "connectionIP":null,
        "connectionPort":null
    }
NOTE: Replace null with target IP & target port.

"miscConfig" is pleace where all the other stuff be stored. 

Example of config above:
"miscConfig":{
        "updateURL":"https://github.com/TanishiWalter/SillyNet"
    }
